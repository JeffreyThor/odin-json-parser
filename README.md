# Odin JSON Parser
## Disclaimer!
Don't actually use this. Odin has a built in JSON parser.
This was just a fun project for me to get used to Odin.
Poor error handling, missing edge cases, but you get the idea.

Also I saw a Ginger Bill tweet saying "write a parser for JSON from scratch" and had to make sure I could 🤷🏻‍♂️.
